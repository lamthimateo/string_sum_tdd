# String Sum TDD Implementation

## To-Do List:
1. **Handle two valid natural number strings**: The sum of `"2"` and `"3"` should return `"5"`.
2. **Handle one or both invalid inputs**: If the input is invalid, it should be treated as `"0"`.
3. **Handle empty string inputs**: An empty string should be treated as `"0"`.
4. **Handle very large numbers**: The sum should handle large numbers as string inputs.

## Steps:
- First, I wrote a failing test for valid number input.
- Then, I implemented the production code to make the test pass.
- Next, I added tests for invalid input handling.
- Finally, I tested for very large numbers and refactored the code where necessary.
